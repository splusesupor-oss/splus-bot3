"""Single source of truth for global-owner authentication.

The canonical owner is deployment ``config/owner.json``.  Termux keeps mutable
runtime files in a private data directory, so an older copied ``owner.json``
may still exist there.  ``get_owner()`` always reads the deployment source and
atomically synchronizes any differing runtime copy.  No owner ID is embedded
in Python code and a stale runtime value is never used as a fallback.
