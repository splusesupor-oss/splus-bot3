"""Hard isolation guard between bot instances (B1/main, B2/bot2, B3/bot3).

Why this module exists
----------------------
Before this guard, the *only* thing deciding which runtime directory a clone
used was the ``BOT_INSTANCE`` environment variable.  Three concrete failure
modes were reproducible from the repositories:

* ``run.sh`` / ``run_bot.sh`` never set ``BOT_INSTANCE``; they exec
  ``watchdog.py`` directly.  On a B2 clone with no ``.bot_instance`` marker the
  launcher therefore resolved to ``main`` and wrote into the **B1** runtime
  directory.
* The sibling clone shipped ``bot3.py``
  launcher was shipped inside the B1/B2 repositories.
  Running either of those from the wrong clone silently creates/uses the other
  bot's runtime directory.
* An environment variable could contradict the clone's own marker with no
  warning at all.

The guard makes the *clone* itself authoritative through a small marker file,
and turns any contradiction into a loud, early failure.

Rules
-----
1. A clone declares the instance it owns in ``.bot_instance`` next to
   ``main.py`` (one line, no whitespace significance).
2. ``BOT_INSTANCE`` may be set by a launcher, but it must never *contradict*
   the marker.  Contradiction => :class:`InstanceConflict`.
3. A missing marker is only accepted for the implicit ``main`` instance, or
   when the caller explicitly asks to bootstrap it.  Launchers never stamp a
   marker silently; ``b2.sh`` does it once, on purpose, as an operator action.
4. This module never reads, writes or deletes another instance's data.
